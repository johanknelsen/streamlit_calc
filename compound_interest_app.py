        - **Start Year**: The year when the withdrawal begins (year 1 is the first year).
        - **End Year**: Optional - when the withdrawal ends. Leave blank to continue until the end of the simulation.
        - **Simulation Analysis**: After running the simulation, examine the success rate and distribution of outcomes to evaluate your plan.
        - **Sustainability**: A success rate of 95% or higher generally indicates a sustainable withdrawal plan.
        - **Yearly Detail Table**: The new table shows year-by-year performance for the median path, helping you understand how your investment might grow over time.
